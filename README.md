**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PeterVerzhanskyi/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PeterVerzhanskyi/tree/main/linux_sql)]: Created and deployed a Linux cluster monitoring agent built on a Docker-contained PostgreSQL database to perform data analysis about node performance. Developed a bash script to automate creating/starting/stopping the PSQL Docker container based on arguments to the script. Automated the creation of PSQL database tables using a custom DDL script. Developed shell scripts to connect to the PSQL database and populate tables using Linux hardware monitoring commands. Automated the collection of node usage data on a one-minute interval using crontab. Built and manually tested the app in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provisioned virtual machine using Rocky Linux 9 as the operating system.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PeterVerzhanskyi/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PeterVerzhanskyi/tree/main/core_java)]:
      
  - Grep App: Developed a robust simulation of the Linux Grep Command Line Tool in Core Java. Leveraged Maven for build management and Docker for deployment. This tool allows users to input a regex pattern, specify a starting directory, and select an output file, generating a comprehensive list of matched lines for further analysis, enhancing search efficiency and data handling.
  - Stock Quote App: Developed a Personal Stock Wallet application in Core Java, allowing users to buy, sell, and track stocks effortlessly. Integrated an external RESTful API for real-time stock data retrieval and utilized PostgreSQL via JDBC for managing a centralized repository of stock information. This platform-independent application ensures seamless operation across various systems, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PeterVerzhanskyi/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_PeterVerzhanskyi/tree/main/python_data_analytics)]: Delivered data-driven insights for an online retailer by analyzing sales performance and customer behavior.
